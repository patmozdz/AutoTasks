Ideas to do:
Change entire 'reminder' system to be a 'check-in' system so ChatGPT understands the purpose better

Add method to truncate history. Currently, the entire conversation with ALL messages is sent with each request, so as a conversation continues, more and more tokens will be used.
Truncate older messaged by maybe just including system prompt + 5 most recent messages (maybe even make it depend on the length of the messages too, so anywhere from 3-7 most recent messages).

Make sure there aren't race conditions for edit_reminder().

Set up recurrence for recurrence interval in reminders.

Change datetime.now() to use timezones

Add CELERY_RESULTS_BACKEND so that results of periodic celery worker are stored for logging purposes

When using twilio_client.messages.create, use messaging_service_sid instead of from_. Twilio's messaging service has a lot of features that may be needed.

Secure the webhook by validating incoming Twilio requests
