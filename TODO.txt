Ideas to do:
Change entire 'reminder' system to be a 'check-in' system so ChatGPT understands the purpose better

Add method to truncate history. Currently, the entire conversation with ALL messages is sent with each request, so as a conversation continues, more and more tokens will be used.
Truncate older messaged by maybe just including system prompt + 5 most recent messages (maybe even make it depend on the length of the messages too, so anywhere from 3-7 most recent messages).

Make sure there aren't race conditions for edit_reminder().

Set up recurrence for recurrence interval in reminders.

Change datetime.now(timezone) to use the user's timezone

Add CELERY_RESULTS_BACKEND so that results of periodic celery worker are stored for logging purposes

When using twilio_client.messages.create, use messaging_service_sid instead of from_. Twilio's messaging service has a lot of features that may be needed.

Secure the webhook by validating incoming Twilio requests

In docker-compose.yml use Azure managed identity instead of environmental variables

Include an 'if settings.DEBUG = true' (or whatever it is) check to differentiate between production and developement code instead of commenting stuff out

Migrate to using Discord due to new toll free phone number regulations

Put secrets_manager as it's own service (it's own Docker container). This decouples the secrets_manager from Django. The secrets_manager service can then expose a lightweight API for any app to access secrets.

Fix sending back an empty message when first message is not REGISTER because it generates an error 400 Bad Requests instead of doing nothing.

Protect against injection attacks (maybe people putting print statement to learn internal workings or plain code in messages? Check if it's a concern)

Fix issue where celerybeat and celery are out of sync with system time. See below for snippet of celery container log:
2024-02-02 14:46:00 [2024-02-02 20:46:00,018: INFO/ForkPoolWorker-16] Task reminders.tasks.watch_for_reminder_time[468869e8-112f-4f16-b36a-4821e2af66c4] succeeded in 0.01522400599787943s: None
As visible, the system time is '2024-02-02 14:46:00', but the celery worker time is '2024-02-02 20:46:00,018'. Perhaps timezones must be implemented to fix this
